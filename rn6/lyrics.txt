[404] 

four hundred and four -
bloody numbers in the night
i need you no more
'cause i'm not able to fight
your final surprise
on the edge of my way
the monochrome eyes
of your pornography
scan dead FM waves -
full of passion and fear
for nightcity maze
and for girl that was near
like bitmap image
she smiled always to you
someone opened her cage -
and dreams never come true...

* * *

my unreachable girl
forget that numbers can lie
'cause when my time is gone
you won't hear my goodbye
nameless lost grave -
heart is idling no more
disconnected as slave
and four hundred and four-
stigmatized on your back
like reset karma tattoo
your tears became noisy-black
and i'll never find you
unauthorized access -
absence without leave
thoughts in a mess...
i think, i have to go heave...

* * *

four hundred and four 
not found alive

four hundred and four 
no chance to survive

four hundred and four
you're lost in hell

four hundred and four
say me farewell...


[navigated]

navigate around bloody concrete
ambulance car has come too late
suicide rush, fairway lost
save this checkpoint at any cost

acceleration of gravity drive
moth-eaten wetware is no more alive
crash landing in the TV screen -
running broad jump from window sill

ambulance sirens or i am asleep
see you tomorrow in morgue... on your lips
i'll be a tear of cold autumn rain
serial number is now my name

* * *

see you tomorrow - in twilight of morgue
obituary notice is my error log
see you tomorrow - in spring of my years
and then - try to forget my cadaver face... 

see you tomorrow - in twilight of morgue
obituary notice is my epilogue
see you tomorrow – in corporate grave
beyond soundtrack of dead radio wave...


[karma]

i read your blogs but can’t recall you
observed your eyes in bustling street
we hear each other in the dernier cry
your catwalk is too far from me
this avenue retains your light step
these slums remember my decay
who clipped your wings, who made my life a misery?
whose number blinks on call display?
i was a hero, now I’m a traitor
you were a drop in sullen rain
i was a tick in capital sentence
without chance to catch your train…

now we operate other bodies
you’ll never recognize my face
i’ll never catch you in the crowd
another blood in our veins 
transfers again forbidden pleasure
is boiling when we sleep alone
another dream that we are watching
helps to forget ancestral home
you were a slave, now you’re the master
i was a victim and I am
you rush for airplane in Berlin
my corpse got cold in midnight tram…


[after tommorrow]

red line - fairway on your hand
coordinates of coming end
breaking news - and you silent smile
and your bleeding heart is no more mine
endless rain as the end of your story
system files are now for read only
neuro engines are damaged
soul has left it's body cage

* * *

how can i clone your flesh?
and download your soul from hell?
or better i'll kill myself...
or better i'll kill myself again...

* * *

chrome dust on cadaver fingers
last corridor to the opened window
i'll be waiting there for you -
let's enjoy the dark side of the moon
red line - fairway on our bed
coordinates of of coming end
breaking news - and you silent smile
and your bleeding heart is no more mine

* * *

how can i clone your flesh?
and download your soul from hell?
or better i'll kill myself...
or better i'll kill myself again...


[black clinic]

hysteretic error in my head
last evening doctor's round
unpleasant touch sensation and
exhaustion background
my strength of mind decays
surgery team is waiting
my soul was burnt in the x-rays
you were so fucking pretty

my girl...

* * *

hospital bed usage -
now we are on the edge
of our love at death's door
and we were living for -
emergency service attempts,
painkiller in her hands,
karma re-activation,
and feelings debilitation...

* * *

i'm not recoverable malfunction
spare parts are sold to junk shop
grey dusk concealed forcible abduction
my body waits for coded stop...
life support for the rest of life
binary scream in wires
no chance to stay here alive
and now i feel the silence...

* * *

hospital bed usage -
now we are on the edge
of our love at death's door
and we were living for -
emergency service attempts,
painkiller in her hands,
karma re-activation,
and feelings debilitation...


[NEURO]

last winter graved all memories
all disappointed yesterdays
all fragments of recycled dream
and delay of premortal scream -
i'm dying hear, i'll die without
your plastic cross and punished god
without you i'll celebrate -
so hurry up, evacuate...

* * *

last winter graved all fiends and friends
ethereal ice in shaking hands
grey alleys are blinking in the dusk
my death is still wearing your mask
game over and i'm crying hear
without painkiller and you near -
without you i'll integrate
into the core of coming fate...

* * *

horizons are now interface
of final level, health percents
displaying that the death is near
last winter graved all pain and fear
i'm dying hear, i'll die without
prosthetics and your donor blood
without you i'll celebrate
i'll celebrate my endless end...


[bruteforce]

two colors only
monochrome and liquid red
escape-landscape in window
aren't you mad?
existing conditions 
can't deny your smile
delivering my body
from this rusty sky
trapped like a virus
lost in cyberspace
give me a reason
to leave your place

* * *

connecting to your body
opening your veins.
my hate declaration
finally begins

* * *

blinding halo
incandescent tungsten
mind treatment -
i'll never be your fan
existing conditions 
can't deny my role
delivering your body
from nonexistent soul

* * *

connecting to your body
opening your veins
my hate declaration
finally begins...


[cyberpunk]

industrial rain and worn out smiles -
i'm walking with you in the smog
we left our home, dropped our knives
and gently escaped in this patch of fog
we've found our port of refuge and calm
tank ship became rusty - have it your way
healing the grievous bodily harm
let's get tight in this neon cafe...

lips are unmapped and forever closed
'cause our dreams contained crime
never fear, 'cause they're lost
we knew, how to kill time
game directive is read only, and -
is intended for pay-days
when we buy a new digital story - 
for the special case...

industrial rain and worn out smiles -
i'm walking with you in the smog
we left our home, dropped our knives
and gently escaped in this patch of fog...


[spare parts]

reanimation without flashback
but full of screenshots of sin
suffering and brutal treatment -
barbed wires across my skin
hell guardians are awoken,
are searching for me in the night
bloody footsteps betray my escape
detected in infrared light...

* * *

and my princess became a whore
i found her corpse on the Rubicon shore
our wedding-rings are spare parts -
our freeware love has fallen apart
these horizons of restless days
this existence in time delays
sex before capital punishment -
last present from the government
an alphabet has chosen her name -
the time has come to feel the pain
now we should move in real-time
the time has come, the time to die...

* * *

reanimation and total recall
full of screenshots of surgery -
our batwings were amputated
and we can't suck other energy
security modes are activated
cops are searching for us in the night
your convulsions betray my escape
detected in infrared light...

* * *

and my princess became a whore
i found her corpse on the Rubicon shore
our wedding-rings are spare parts -
our freeware love has fallen apart
these horizons of restless days
this existence in time delays
sex before capital punishment -
last present from the government
an alphabet has chosen her name -
the time has come to feel the pain
now we should move in real-time
the time has come, the time to die...


[keygen]

this is the catwalk
maintenance for dead
give me a promise
and i won't be sad
accepting my fall
time-out and excuse
all suicide raids
not possible to use   

your smile

detecting the numbers
watching around the edge
looking for exit
when your voice begins to flange
permanent waiting
inactive state of mind
accepting the distress
not possible to die   

alone

setting the limit
calling back home
checking the digits
on the gravestone
undying flowers
plastic emergency
file-info text
access to me   

i wait 


[clockwise]

was strangled without you... face-to-face
located in black-and-white recorder trace
worst lethal thoughts, based on the rest of my time
and all your circular trips are finally mine...

call button is bleeding, hello - and phantom-limb pain
display illumination reflected on wet monorail
at standstill are all clockwise rotating parts
of our metal discard and black market implants...

denial for non-payment and eyelid closure reflex
forever isolated in thoughts of illicit sense
night-long terms of intimacy beneath our eyes 
neon signs are transmitting the barefaced lies...

was strangled without you... face-to-face
located in black-and-white recorder trace
this outer city hid me like the realm of shadows
and only creeping lines on unruffled meadows...


[denergized]

i want you...
my dirty rain
grey lips through dust 
and rusty autumn wind...

i need her vision -
erased the tapes
de-energized and
trapped in memories...

06:12 a.m.
re-animate -
and kill again
your hidden yesterdays

* * *

alone and numb -
in covert channel
of nightclub
with pretty fiend apart

bring me bad news -
search for her profile
in the streets...
in lethal interface

beyond my dream
beyond decay -
re-incarnate again
for neon yesterdays...


[DNA]

missing the target, i unload my gun
can't hate your beauty, so you can run 
never recall your warm naked skin 
personal hell, as a ticket to win
how can i flow in the enemy line?
without you and without call-sign?
morning farewell and the sound of rain
in the background for my single game...

quicken your steps - there's someone behind
someone will die in this december night 
your plastic hero has just left his life
it was your nightmare, you are still alive

drug dosage form - nonfixed access
now i need only artificial sense
creep' line can't lead me to your cold bed
median strip - all the memories dead
i'll be fine, i'll be OK
i sold my soul, but not DNA...


[empty cell]

tonight... i'm not ready for crime
you're not ready to die
i'm not ready for war
i'm not waiting for you

please, take my bleeding hand
you're still my final friend
draw the diseased flatline
connect your flesh to mine
connect my veins to knife
log-out from carrion life
be quiet, be quit, be clear
my bath... like hell's carrier

* * *

tonight... you've forgotten my name
running to morgue in the rain
i was waiting for sign
i was ready for lie -

implanted in your breath
verifying my death
making white-hot our lips
giving the farewell kiss
in blue suburban light
de-energized city night
as long as you are here
although the end is near


[body prison]

the sky smells like your blood
and your last photo on ID-card
and your last reverb telephone goodbye
but username can never die

passive resistance, wait for me
i'll taste the hell's extreme degree
i'll fly above the limbo gates
i loved you, but now it's too late...

* * *

now you're enemy from my nightmares
now you're damage for all my systems -
distress signal in body wires
and so I am your first victim

our perverted love's sweet decay
rusty clouds and neon digits
now your last words are floating away
with your poisoned perfume spirits...

* * *

the night smells like your skin
no possibility for me to win
no chance to find your empty shell
no chance to say the last farewell

dead assets of the dear past
our heroes died in live broadcast
i came the day after the fair
i've lost your breath in prison air...

* * *

now you're enemy from my nightmares
now you're damage for all my systems
distress signal in body wires
and so I am your first victim

our perverted love's sweet decay
rusty clouds and neon digits
now your last words are floating away
with your poisoned perfume spirits...


[rainbow hunt / VHS autumn]

you are my midnight patient
you are my neon beauty
you are my strange relation
you are my fall of duty


your lips discover my space
your lips discover chaos
innocent lust on your face
bringing two graveyard flowers


you'll come to me through sunsets
horizons, screens and subways
searching for me in the net
you'll find my corpse on Friday


then let's play here your last game
wires're transporting our blood
please, dance with me in the rain
kiss me, as kissed you the mud...
