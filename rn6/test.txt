Крайняя жесть тестового доступа
by ALiEN Assault


    Тестовый  dial-up  доступ  предоставляют  многие  провайдеры,  и  это,  как
правило, обозначено на сайте ISP.

    С  помощью  тестового доступа можно, к примеру, организовать бесплатный IRC
(да любой сервис, в принципе) - кто-то поднимает у себя сервер, а посвященные в
это  могут  его  обнаружить,  просканировав  доступный  диапазон  IP-адресов на
предмет конкретного порта.

    Иногда  можно  и  просто  поисследовать  вышеупомянутый диапазон на предмет
различных интересностей.

    В  случае  одного  конкретного  провайдера  таким образом было обнаружено 5
хостов, на которых имелись:

анонимный FTP с антивирусами
NNTP (требующий авторизации) 
Squid (грамотно настроенный, а то вся тестовость доступа пропала бы =)
DNS

и самое любопытное - один из хостов на порту 23 отозвался вот как:

      7. Implement Multi-level and Multi-region Networking 
      
    Quidway A8010 GK supports multi-level and multi-region networking, shown as
Fig.1-7.  After  lower  level  Gatekeeper obtains the IP address of upper level
Gatekeeper  through  finding  messages  (GRQ)  via DNS and Gatekeeper, it sends
upper  level Gatekeeper messages to request to register. Upper level Gatekeeper
will  authenticate  the  identification of lower level Gatekeeper, so the legal
lower level Gatekeeper can register successfully and the lower level Gatekeeper
with  wrong password will be refused. The same level Gatekeepers need no mutual
registration between them.
 
          1. Multi-level and Multi-region Networking 
      8. Interconnect with GK/GW of other Manufacturers to Network 
      
    A8010  GK can interconnect with other manufacturers’ Gateway or Gatekeeper
supporting standard H.323 protocol. For example, A8010 GK can interconnect with
Gateway  or  Gatekeeper  of  Cisco through two patterns. Shown as Fig.1-8, in B
area,  Cisco Gateway directly is hung down A8010 GK group and is managed by it.
In  C  area, Cisco Gateway is hung down Cisco Gatekeeper, then Cisco Gatekeeper
interconnect with upper level A8010 GK group through RAS messages.

    The  interconnection  with Gateway/Gatekeeper of VocalTec is identical with
the  second  interconnection solution of Cisco. As shown in Fig.1-8, in D area,
VocalTec  Gateway  is  hung  down  VocalTec  Gatekeeper and VocalTec Gatekeeper
interconnect with A8010 GK group through RAS messages. To the accomplishment of
the  manual,  the  latest version of interconnected VT equipment is version 1.5
issued in 2002. 

In addition, it can interconnect with the equipment of Quintum and Avaya through
same way. 

          1. Interconnect with Cisco and VocalTec GK/GW 
      9. Support Billing Networking 
      
    Quidway  A8010  GK  can  interconnect  with  other  manufacturers’ IP phone
equipment  supporting standard H.323 protocol. It can provide detailed bill and
support  accounting  billing between different carriers to network with billing
system as billing center.

    Fig.1-9  shows  the  networking  solution  of  accounting  billing  between
different  carriers,  which  is  supported  by  Huawei  GK. In figure, the left
network  is  managed by carrier A, applying Huawei GK and Huawei GW to network.
The  right  network  is  managed  by carrier B, applying the GK and GW of other
manufacturers to network. The GK and GW of other manufacturers can interconnect
with  Huawei GK and GW. As top GK, Huawei GK can provide detailed bill so as to
support the billing between different carriers. 

          1. Huawei GK Supports Billing Networking 
    2. General Configuration Principles 
    
    The  software  and  hardware  configuration of IGK has unnecessary anything
with   networking.   Workstation   and   software  license  with  corresponding
configuration  are  selected  according  to number of ports of IP phone to save
cost  in  the  precondition  of  meeting  the requirements of system processing
ability and reliability etc.

    When  GK  is  use  to  perform  carrier-class networking, the GK of Solaris
version  is  applied  commonly.  If  less  than  300  E1,  sun  Netra  T1405 is
recommended  to  perform  1+1 backup or single equipment configuration. If more
than  300 E1, Sun Netra T1405 GK group pattern is recommended (N GKs share load
and they are backup each other.).

    When  GK  is  use  to  perform enterprise level networking, the GK of Linux
version is applied commonly. If less than 180 E1, xSeries 330 GK is recommended
to  perform  1+1 backup or single equipment configuration. If more than 180 E1,
IBM  xSeries 330 GK group pattern is recommended (N GKs share load and they are
backup each other.).

  2. Hardware Configuration Descriptions 
Quidway A8010 GK includes two versions: Solaris and Linux version GK.

    The hardware platform of Solaris version GK is Sun Unix workstation or mini
computer  and  the  commonly  applied  type  is  SUN  Netra T1405. The hardware
platform  of  Linux  version  GK  is  xSeries  series PC servers of IBM and the
commonly applied type is IBM xSeries 330.

    GK  applies  Sun  series  Unix  workstation that is configured with 10/100M
network  adapter  and  communicates  with outside through TCP/IP protocol. This
hardware platform is supplied 220V/110V AC power.

Optional configuration principles:

    1).  When  GK  and  AGK  are  deployed  together  and  both apply SUN T1405
equipment,  all  SUN  servers  are  put  in  cabinet.  Here,  all  SUN  T  1405
workstations  are  not  configured  with  monitor,  keyboard and mouth but each
workstation  requires  configuring  with a serial port cable to install Solaris
operation system. After the installation of system is completed, the server can
Telnet via network cable to perform system operation management.

(Note: the GK in this section indicates IGK, not including AGK. AGK indicates
 ONLY system.).

    2).  When  GK is deployed separately or it networks with other types of GW,
it  must  not  be  put  in  cabinet. But its configuration is same as that when
deployed with AGK together.

    The  GK  applying  Sun  Netra T1405 as hardware platform can be used in the
access of less than 300 E1 as single equipment.

          2. Appearance of GK applying IBM eserver xSeries 330 as hardware
           Platform 
    Quidway  A8010  GK,  configured  with  10/100M network adapter, applies IBM
xSeries  series  PC  servers  and  communicates  with  outside via TCP/IP. This
hardware platform is supplied 220V/110V AC power.

Optional configuration principles:

    1) When GK and AGK are deployed together and both apply IBM X330 equipment,
all IBM X330 servers are put in cabinet. Here, all IBM X330 servers regarded as
GK are not configured with monitor, keyboard and mouth but each server requires
configuring  with  “server  cascading  cable” to connect other IBM X330 servers
regarded  as  AGK.  One  of  IBM  X330  servers connects to keyboard, mouse and
monitor  (The  one-transfer-three  cable  is  provided by ONLY system.) via one
“xSeries330monitor/keyboard/mouse  cable”. After the installation is completed,
the server can Telnet via network cable.

    When  GK  and  AGK are deployed together, the number of configured “server
cascading  cable’  and “xSeries330 monitor/keyboard/mouse cable” for GK and
AGK meets the following formula:

Number of server cascading cable =Total number of IBM X330 server used by GK
and AGK-1

Number of xSeries330 monitor/keyboard/mouse cable=1

(Note: the GK in this section indicates IGK, not including AGK. AGK indicates
 ONLY system.).

    2)  When  GK  is deployed separately or it networks with other types of GW,
each  IBM  X330  server  as  GK should be configured with monitor, keyboard and
mouse  because of no cabinet. And one “xSeries330 monitor/keyboard/mouse cable”
should  be configured to the IBM X330 sever host to connect keyboard, mouse and
monitor.

    The  GK  applying xSeries330 as hardware platform can be used in the access
less than 180 E1 and mainly used in enterprise network.

    3. Hardware List and Optional Configuration Principles of Client 
    
    GK  system can be managed through web and Telnet command line logging at PC
clients.  At  the  same time, the UNIX and LINUX system where the GK is located
can  be managed through Telnet at PC client. One common desktop computer can be
applied at the PC client.

  3. Software Platform and Software List and Optional Configuration Principles of
     Third Party 
     
    The  GK  of  Unix  version  and  Linux version respectively applies Solaris
operation system of SUN and Linux operation system of Red Hat.

    1. Software Platform and Optional Configuration Principles of GK Based on Unix
       Platform 
       
    The software platform of IGK workstation is the Solaris operation system of
SUN  and  the  present  version  is  7.  When  Solaris system is installed, the
supported  language  can be selected according to demands. In overseas version,
English  can  be  selected and Chinese can be selected for domestic version. No
matter  what  language  system  is  installed, both Chinese/English man machine
interfaces can be supported as logging through WEB or Telnet command line at PC
client if Chinese operation system is installed at PC client.

      1. Expansion Methods and Principles 
IGKV200 design adopts IGK group pattern. When existing IGK group cannot meet
work demands, one IGK can be added into group to enhance processing ability of
system.
 
          1. IGK Group Pattern Supports Smooth Expansion of System 
    Show  as Fig.8-1, IGK-M first obtain static address list of IGK through DNS
resolution.  The  address  list includes IP addresses of all IGK of same group.
After  getting  address list, GW send GRQ message to IGK to request the address
of  active  IGK. The IGK receiving GRQ message should send GCF message with IGK
list in order according to the present load between IGK. Because DNS resolution
is  adopted,  only  the DNS configuration files in DNS Server need modifying as
expanding  system. New IGK can be added through adding IP address of new IGK to
configuration  files,  without  modification  of GW configuration, to implement
smooth expansion of system.

    When  the  processing ability of hardware (workstation) meets requirements,
only  adding  the  number  of  software License can implement expansion. If the
processing  ability  is not enough, one workstation with same configuration can
be  considered  to  add to perform distributed processing. Changing hardware is
not considered commonly.

    II.  When  GK and AGK are deployed together and both GK and AGK applied IBM
X330equipment, the required number of configured “server cascading cable” for
GK and AGK meets the following formula:

Number of server cascading cable =Total number of IBM X330 server used by GK and
AGK-1

So the configuration of AGK should be referred for the actual required number of
“server cascading cable”.
